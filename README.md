# dots

Dotfiles in NixOS configuration format.

Machines are specific hosts that i use.
Roles are sets of programs/configs that i want to run in combination.
Programs are program-specific configuration, usually using home-manager.

# colours

I use base16 to sync the same colour scheme across the following applications:
  - `alacritty`
  - `discord`
  - `firefox`
  - `gtk2/3`
  - `i3`
  - `rofi`
  - `spotify`
  - `vscode`

This can be seen in `roles/desktop.nix`
